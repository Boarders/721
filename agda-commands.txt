basic AGDA commands (in vscode; check your own editor)

["C-x C-y" means "press and hold the ctrl key and while holding it down press the x key and then the y key (and then let go)".]

C-c C-l	  	LOAD the file for agda to check everything

    eg use to check everything complies, or
    	to open up holes at the locations where you've written a "?"

C-c C-,	   	display the goal and context in a hole

    eg, navigate the cursor into a hole then see what is needed to fill it
    
C-c C-space	check that a term in a hole has the correct type

    eg after typing a term into a hole, see if agda accepts it
    	this doesn't guarantee that you've written the correct answer but it
	does guarantee that it has the required type

C-c C-c	     	split a hole into CASES

    eg navigate into a hole and type one or more variable names either preceded or followed by C-c or C-c

C-c C-r	      	REFINE a goal into one or more subgoals

    eg in a hole, type a name of a function which outputs a term of the desired type;
       after C-c C-r, agda will prompt you to supply the input term(s).

C-c C-n	     	 compute the NORMAL form of a term

    eg after loading a file, this gives a window for you to type the name of a term; do so, then press return, to see the normal form of that term.
    pro tip: turn off the safe flag and postulate some variables for more complicated terms
